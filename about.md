## About Me

I’m a software engineer specializing in the .NET ecosystem — from API design and modular architecture to debugging weird edge cases.

I’m driven by curiosity and a desire to deeply understand how things work. I enjoy building thoughtful, testable, and maintainable systems that solve real problems — not just pass acceptance tests.

## Why This Blog

I created this blog to:

- Archive and share in-depth .NET solutions
- Document architectural patterns I’ve found useful in real projects
- Help other engineers avoid the same dead ends I've hit
- Sharpen my own understanding by teaching what I learn

This isn't a place for shortcuts or "just paste this" answers — it’s where I publish things I’d want to reference later (and hopefully, you will too).
